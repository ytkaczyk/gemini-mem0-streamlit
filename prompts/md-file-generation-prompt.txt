I am planning to create a project with python for demonstrating the mem0 library (https://docs.mem0.ai/overview). I want the demo to use:
- Supabase as a vector database (https://docs.mem0.ai/components/vectordbs/dbs/supabase)
- neo4j as a graph database (https://docs.mem0.ai/open-source/graph_memory/overview)
- gemini as LLM (https://docs.mem0.ai/components/llms/models/gemini)
- Provide a chat based frontend using streamlit (https://streamlit.io/)
You can perform grounded searches to learn more about the technology. 
Then create a PLANNING.md and TASK.md files.

PLANNING.md - high level direction, scope, tech, etc.
TASK.md - initial tasks to knock out for the project
